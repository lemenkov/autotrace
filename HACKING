		    Notes for autotrace developers

* How to release
  
  (0) Update NEWS file
  (1) Version number in configure.in
  (2) CVS tagging
  (3) sourceforge(https://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=781&group_id=1)

* CVS

See https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=11789 

The module name is autotrace.  After checking out the codes, invoke
autogen.sh in the distribution. That generates configure.in,
Makefile.in and so on. autogen.sh invokes automake, autoconf, aclocal
and autofig.


* Autofig

Autofig generate autotrace-config.in from autotrace-config.af.
You can get autofig from:

http://autotrace.sourceforge.net/tools/

You can get the LATEST version of autofig.
http://cvs.gnome.org/bonsai/rview.cgi?cvsroot=/cvs/gnome&dir=autofig

* Library

Here is a sample progaram that uses libautotrace.a.
To compile, invoke following commands:
gcc sample.c `./autotrace-config --libs` `./autotrace-config --cflags`

/* sample.c */
#include <autotrace/autotrace.h>

int main()
{
  char * fname = "img/triangle.png";
  at_fitting_opts_type * opts = at_fitting_opts_new();
  at_input_read_func rfunc = at_input_get_handler(fname);
  at_bitmap_type * bitmap ;
  at_splines_type * splines;
  at_output_write_func wfunc = at_output_get_handler_by_suffix("eps");

  bitmap = at_bitmap_read(rfunc, fname);
  splines = at_splines_new(bitmap, opts);
  at_splines_write(splines, stdout, "", 
                   AT_DEFAULT_DPI,
		   wfunc);
  return 0;
}


* Tag naming scheme

CVS tag for version X.Y: RELEASE_X_Y. 
CVS tag for version X.YpreN: PRERELEASE_X_Y_N.

* Web page

    From sourceforge.org:

    5. Setup your group's web site.

    I'll assume that you have some sort of web
    page or site built already that you wish to put up on
    SourceForge to give your group a public face.
    Login to SourceForge using SSH, for example ;

    ssh -l loginname yourproject.sourceforge.net

    you will now be in your home directory. All
    group files are stored in a directory structure for each
    project. The group directory structure is
    split out by the first, then first and second, letters of
    the project name. From here all group files
    are stored in /home/groups/y/yo/yourproject.
    Change to this directory. All your web pages
    are stored in the htdocs directory. Going in here will
    contain index.php, which is a blank page that
    says you haven't uploaded a web page yet.
    Logout, and copy the files for your web page
    using scp, a program which comes with ssh. For
    example:

    scp localfile loginname@yourproject.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/y/yo/yourproject/htdocs/

    I suggest you gzip up your site, send it in
    one go using scp, then login with ssh and gunzip it.

    So what should be on the web page ? Perhaps
    you'd like the following, as well as your project's
    information ;

    1.A link to the projects group page on SourceForge.
    2.Mailing list links (we'll create them in a second)
    3.A SourceForge icon and web counter - see the site documentation for this.
    4.A link to the CVS web interface at

    http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/?cvsroot=yourproject

    5.Some info about using CVS specific to your project.
    6.Setup mailing lists for your project.

    If your project isn't that active yet (or only
    has one lonely developer) your mailing lists will be
    very quiet, however I still suggest you look
    to the future and setup three standard lists for your
    project: a devel list for developers, a users
    list for users, and an announce list for new version
    announcements.

    Do this via your group page using the mailing
    list admin link. Its quite simple so you shouldn't
    have any problems...
